\description{
Irreplaceability scores can be used to assess the relative importance
of planning units in a solution to a conservation planning
\code{\link{problem}}.
}
\details{
The following methods are available for calculating
  irreplaceability scores:
  \describe{

  \item{\code{\link{replacement_cost}}}{Calculate irreplaceability scores
    based on the replacement cost method described in Cabeza and Moilanen
    (2006). This method is recommended for calculating irreplaceability
    scores.}

  \item{\code{\link{ferrier_score}}}{Calculate irreplaceability scores
    using the method outlined in Ferrier \emph{et al.} (2000).}

  \item{\code{\link{rarity_weighted_richness}}}{Calculate irreplaceability
    scores using rarity weighted richness. This method is only recommended
    for particularly large-scale conservation planning problems where
    the replacement cost method would take too long to produce scores in
    a feasible period of time.}

  }
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# load data
data(sim_pu_raster, sim_pu_polygons, sim_features)

# build minimal conservation problem with raster data
p1 <- problem(sim_pu_raster, sim_features) \%>\%
      add_min_set_objective() \%>\%
      add_relative_targets(0.1) \%>\%
      add_binary_decisions() \%>\%
      add_default_solver(gap = 0, verbose = FALSE)

# solve the problem
s1 <- solve(p1)

# plot solution
plot(s1, main = "solution", axes = FALSE, box = FALSE)

# calculate irreplaceability scores using replacement cost scores
ir1 <- replacement_cost(p1, s1)

# calculate irreplaceability scores using Ferrier et al 2000 method
ir2 <- ferrier_score(p1, s1)

# calculate irreplaceability scores using rarity weighted richness scores
ir3 <- rarity_weighted_richness(p1, s1)

# plot irreplaceability scores
plot(stack(ir1, ir2, ir3), axes = FALSE, box = FALSE,
     main = c("replacement cost", "Ferrier score",
              "rarity weighted richness"))
